## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

### Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
> Software Engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems and it is important as it plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life e.g healthcare.
>

### Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
>
1. Development of programming languages e.g Fotran, C
2. Establishment of software engieering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. Arrival/Onset of structured programming in the 1970s
>

### List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements -Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design -Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation -Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing -Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment -Releasing the software to the end users or customers.
6. Maintenance -Provide ongoing support updates and enhancements tp the software after deployment. 

### Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distint phases flowing downwards like a waterfall e.g requirements, design and implementation, It is best suited for projects with well defined requirements that are inlikely to change, whereas Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change, it is best suited for projects with changing requirements or a high degree of uncertainty. 
A scenario for waterfall methodlogy would be a large scale software developmnt project with a clear set of requirements tha areunlikely to change significantly overtime. An example includes building a new software system for a financial institution whereas agile methodology scenario would be a project with changing requirements or where the team needs to respondquickly to feedback.An example would be developing a mobile app that requires multiple iterations of user testing and feature development.

### Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
A quality Assuarance Engineer is responsible in ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A project manager is responsible in overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

### Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is important because it is a software suite that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code, examples include Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA whereas Version Control Systems (VCS) is important because it is a Software tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members examples inclide Git, Subversion.

### What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges faced by software engineers include:
1. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

### Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Software Quality assurance (QA) in software engineering is important because it involves the systematic process of ensuring that software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

### Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting,clear questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering is important when interacting with AI models because it helps avoid vague answers and confusion by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need

### Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is "What is surgery?" whereas a prompt engineered question would specify what speciality of surgery i want to know about e.g "What is pedeiatric surgery?" The propmt engineered question asks the AI to focus on only paedeatric surgery which is done on children only. Where as the vague prompt does not specify and could include all specialties in surgery.
